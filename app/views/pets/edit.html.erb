<%#
  ✏️ EDIT VIEW: Form to update a pet (UPDATE action - step 1)
  Connected to: PetsController#edit
  Receives: @pet (existing Pet record from database)
  Form submits to: PetsController#update
%>

<div class="container mt-5">
  <h1>Edit <%= @pet.name %></h1>

    📦 RENDER PARTIAL: DRY principle!
    This loads the SAME _form.html.erb as new.html.erb
    But @pet is pre-filled with existing data this time!
    The form is smart enough to know it should UPDATE instead of CREATE
  %>
  <%= render "form" %>
</div>
